  headline: A year ago, we reimagined how we study deep topics in machine learning.
  content: As part of our time during the Google AI Residency, we wanted to find a
    better way to study and understand important machine learning papers and ideas.
    We found that many papers often assumed a set of requisite knowledge, which prevented
    us from deeply appreciating the contribution or novelty of the work. <br><br>To
    this end, we designed <a href="https://www.depthfirstlearning.com/"><strong>Depth
    First Learning</strong></a>, a pedagogy for diving deep into machine learning by carefully tailoring
    a curriculum around a particular paper or concept in small, focused
    discussion groups. So far, we've created guides for <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/InfoGAN">InfoGAN</a>,
    <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/TRPO">TRPO</a>, <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/AlphaGoZero">AlphaGoZero</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/DeepStack">DeepStack</a><strong>.</strong>

  content: 1. A small self-contained group convenes online to understand a particular
    paper in depth with one or two preselected group guides.<br><br>2. The guides
    plan ahead, writing a document that maps the dependencies from the target paper
    back to sound source material and problems sets.<br><br>3. The group discusses
    the dependencies over 5-6 weekly sessions. They write up solutions to problems
    and add comments on the document itself, creating a living representation of their
    understanding.<br><br><strong>The document is made public afterwards and all
    credit goes to the guides and the group.</strong>

a high-quality curricula targeting a particular paper in machine learning.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Towards this end, we are launching
the Depth First Learning Fellowship. Chosen fellows will each be given a <strong>$4000 grant</strong>
to help design the curricula for and lead a DFL group. The group will run for 5-6 weeks remotely via video conferencing.
</p>
<br />
<p>
We will support each group by finding
6-8 motivated students with the relevant background experience, and connecting fellows
with
experts in the field to act as advisors.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<p>
	Here are the characteristics that we are looking for in candidates:
<br/>
</p>
<br />
 <p><b>• Exhibit mathematical maturity</b>: Fellows target meaningful papers which depend on fundamental concepts in mathematics, statistics, and information theory. They should understand the fundamentals in order to plan a curriculum.  </p>
<br />
  <p><b>• Effectively communicate scientific ideas</b>: A primary responsibility of the fellow is effectively communicating ideas central to research papers and moderating discussions among group participants. Previous experience with teaching or organizing classes is a bonus.</p>
<br />
 <p><b>• Commit strongly to make the DFL sessions a success</b>: This primarily entails
designing curricula with sufficient rigour and exercises for the classes. From previous iterations, we estimate this to take around 12 hours a week. We will help you in this process with regular feedback.</p>
<br />
 <p><b>• Value group learning</b>: Encourage positive interactions in study sessions.</p>
<br />
