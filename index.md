  headline: A year ago, we reimagined how we study deep topics in machine learning.
  content: As part of our time during the Google AI Residency, we wanted to find a
    better way to study and understand important machine learning papers and ideas.
    We found that many papers often assumed a set of requisite knowledge, which prevented
    us from deeply appreciating the contribution or novelty of the work. <br><br>To
    this end, we designed <a href="https://www.depthfirstlearning.com/"><strong>Depth
    First Learning</strong></a>, a pedagogy for diving deep by carefully tailoring
    a curriculum around a particular ML paper or concept and leading small, focused
    discussion groups. So far, we've created guides for <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/InfoGAN">InfoGAN</a>,
    <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/TRPO">TRPO</a>, <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/AlphaGoZero">AlphaGoZero</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/DeepStack">DeepStack</a><strong>.</strong>

  content: 1. A small self-contained group convenes online to understand a particular
    paper in depth with one or two preselected group guides.<br><br>2. The guides
    plan ahead, writing a document that maps the dependencies from the target paper
    back to sound source material and problems sets.<br><br>3. The group discusses
    the dependencies over 5-6 weekly sessions. They write up solutions to problems
    and add comments on the document itself, creating a living representation of their
    understanding.<br><br><strong>At the end, the document is made public, and all
    of the credit goes to the guides and the group.</strong>

    researchers around the world. Now, we want to run new, online classes around the
    world.<br><br>

</p>
<br />
<p>
Towards this end, we are launching
the Depth First Learning fellowship. Chosen fellows will each be given a <strong>$4000 grant</strong>,
to help them design the curricula for a DFL class, that will be held over 4-6 weeks remotely over video conferencing.
</p>
<br />
<p>
We will support each group by finding
6-8 motivated students with the relevant background experience, and connecting fellows
with
experts in the field to act as advisors.</p>
