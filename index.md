  headline: A year ago, we reimagined how we study deep topics in machine learning.
  content: ' We designed <a href="https://www.depthfirstlearning.com/"><strong>Depth
    First Learning</strong></a>, a pedagogy for studying ML fundamentals towards understanding
    important papers. Examples include <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/InfoGAN">InfoGAN</a>,

  content: 1. A small self-contained group convenes to understand a particular paper
    in depth with one or two preselected group guides.<br><br>2. The guides plan ahead,
    writing a document that maps the dependencies from the target paper back to sound
    source material and problems sets.<br><br>3. The group discusses the dependencies
    over 5-6 weekly sessions. They write up solutions to problems and add comments
    on the document itself, creating a living representation of their understanding.<br><br><strong>At
    the end, the document is made public, and all of the credit goes to the guides
    and the group.</strong>
